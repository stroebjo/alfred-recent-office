Recently used Files form Microsoft Office
=========================================


This workflow for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) allows you to search through the recently used files by Word, Excel and PowerPoint on your computer.

It only works with the latest Office 365 Apps and *not* with Office 2011.

To use it just type `excel` (or `word`, `powerpoint`) as you would to open the actual App but now it shows the latest used files as in the start window.

Installation
------------

Just [download the Workflow here](https://github.com/stroebjo/alfred-recent-office/releases) and open it.
